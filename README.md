# meganyap.me

My personal portfolio — a design-focused, interactive site built with Astro and deployed on Cloudflare Workers.

## Features

- Animated starfield, shooting stars, and interactive particle sandbox
- Work case studies with detailed project breakdowns
- Visitor tracking system with an onboarding experience and gallery
- Custom cursor, signature pad, color picker, and other playful interactions
- Responsive design with motion-safe animations

## Tech Stack

- **Astro 5** — SSR with file-based routing and View Transitions
- **Cloudflare Workers + D1** — edge hosting with SQLite for visitor data
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — styling via Vite plugin
- **GSAP** — animation
- **TypeScript**

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Other scripts:

```bash
pnpm build      # build for Cloudflare Workers
pnpm preview    # preview production build
pnpm check      # TypeScript checking
```
